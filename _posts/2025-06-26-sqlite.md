There I was — again — knee-deep in terminal commands, configuring a PostgreSQL server for a tiny side project. I’d just spent 30 minutes setting up users, roles, and permissions. For what? A journaling app that only I was going to use.

Why do we do this to ourselves?

At some point, I think many developers fall into this weird trap where every project, no matter how small, has to be set up like it’s going to IPO next quarter. Cloud-hosted databases. Auth layers. Connection pooling. Load balancers. The whole nine yards — even when the actual application is something like a recipe tracker or a tool to remind me to water my plants.

That’s when I remembered SQLite. Sweet, beautiful, no-nonsense SQLite.

You don’t “spin up” an SQLite instance. You don’t create users or manage passwords. You just… create a file. That’s it. You write some SQL, and your data lives inside that .db file like a little self-contained world. No daemons. No network sockets. No firewalls. No stress.

And the best part? It’s enough. More than enough.

There’s this weird misconception that SQLite isn’t “real” — that it’s only for prototypes or local development. But let’s be honest: most of our solo or internal projects are prototypes, and they do run locally. So why not embrace the tool that’s actually built for that?

“Yeah, but what about concurrency?” someone always says. And sure, SQLite isn’t built for 10,000 simultaneous writes per second. But are you really building something that needs that? More often than not, I’m the only user of my project. Sometimes two or three people tops. SQLite handles that just fine. Reads are fully concurrent, and if you flip on WAL mode, even writes perform better than you'd expect.

Honestly, for most of the stuff we build on weekends or late nights — passion projects, internal dashboards, little utilities — SQLite is not just convenient. It's perfect. It travels with your app, it’s easy to back up, and there’s zero setup. You can drop it into a Git repo and forget it even exists.

So now, when I start a project, I ask myself: am I building the next Slack, or just something useful for me? If it’s the latter — and 9 times out of 10, it is — I skip the server dance. I grab SQLite and get to work.

Because sometimes, you don’t need a database server.

Sometimes, you just need a .db file.
