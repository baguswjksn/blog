Eight months ago, I joined a company as a DevOps Engineer for a major platform in the customer and billing space. Due to a non-disclosure agreement, I can't share which company I work for, but let's just say it’s a well-known ISP.

When I first started, the learning curve was steep. I was diving into a complex environment with a lot of responsibilities and a huge volume of tasks. While the work was interesting, I quickly noticed that a large chunk of my time was being consumed by repetitive, routine tasks—things that could easily be automated, if only I could figure out how.

## The Problem: Repetitive Tasks

At first, the tasks seemed harmless enough: system checks, report generation, data syncing, and manual deployments. But the more I worked, the more I realized how much time was wasted doing the same things every day.

It wasn’t the complexity of the tasks that was draining—it was their frequency. Each task took just enough time to break my flow, and by the end of the day, I had spent more hours repeating the same steps than actually tackling new challenges.

## The Breakthrough: Automating Everything

I realized that I couldn’t just accept this as part of the job. I had to **automate** as much as possible.

The first step was identifying all the tasks that could be automated. Some were simple, like generating regular reports or updating statuses in different tools. Others were a bit trickier, requiring me to create custom solutions that worked within the unique constraints of our production environment.

But automation was not just about saving time—it was about reducing the mental load of constantly juggling multiple tasks. Once I started automating, I found myself with more time to think, plan, and focus on solving real problems.

## The Challenges: Working in a Secure, Isolated Environment

However, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. One of the biggest challenges was working in a **secure, isolated environment**. Unlike most setups, I didn’t have easy access to external resources like the internet or cloud services. Everything had to be self-contained, which meant no quick downloads or external integrations.

This added a layer of complexity, as I had to make sure that everything I used—tools, scripts, or even documentation—was stored locally and could operate without relying on external networks.

This challenge forced me to be more creative and resourceful, finding ways to make automation work within these constraints. But once I cracked that, it felt like I had unlocked a whole new level of efficiency.

## The Results: Cutting My Workday in Half

Fast forward to today: **I’ve successfully cut down my 8-hour shift to just 2 hours** of focused, meaningful work. All the repetitive tasks are handled by automated systems, leaving me with more time to engage in deeper problem-solving, learning, and collaboration.

The time I’ve freed up is now spent on high-priority projects, strategic planning, and enhancing other aspects of the system. Rather than getting bogged down by routine maintenance, I now have the bandwidth to think about future improvements and innovations.

## Final Thoughts

Automation isn’t just about making your life easier—it’s about making your work more impactful. If you’re stuck in a cycle of repetitive tasks, take a step back and ask yourself, **what could you automate?** It’s not always easy, but with a bit of creativity and persistence, it’s incredibly rewarding.

In the end, I’ve learned that even in environments with strict limitations, there’s always room for improvement. It just takes a bit of ingenuity.
