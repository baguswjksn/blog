Forget everything you've been told about creating passwords — things like “use a capital letter and a number,” or those little strength meters that turn green when your password looks “strong.” These rules may give you a false sense of security. They don’t always protect you the way you think they do. To really understand what makes a good password, it helps to look at how password systems actually work — and how hackers try to break them.

### How Passwords Are Stored

When you enter your password to log into a website, your password isn’t stored directly. Instead, it goes through a special kind of scrambling process called hashing. This turns your password into a long, random-looking string of characters. That scrambled version — the “hash” — is what gets stored. The next time you log in, the system scrambles your password again and compares it to what’s saved. If they match, you’re in. The key idea is that you can’t easily reverse this scrambled version back into the original password. Even hackers who steal data from websites can only see the hashes, not your actual password.

### How Hackers Crack Passwords

The only way hackers can figure out what your password is? They have to guess it. They try a possible password, scramble it using the same method, and see if it matches the stored version. This is basically a game of guess-and-check. But here's the good news: if your password is random and long, it can take thousands of years to try every combination. Even with powerful computers, checking every single possible password can be incredibly time-consuming.

### Why Human Passwords Are Weak

The problem is, <span style="background-color: yellow;">people are very predictable.</span> Most of us don’t use truly random passwords. We use common words, names, or numbers like “123,” “password,” or our birth year. We try to follow rules by adding a capital letter or a symbol, but we do it in the same way everyone else does — capitalizing the first letter, adding a symbol at the end, maybe throwing in a recent year. Hackers know this. They use programs that quickly test the most likely passwords first — like English words plus numbers or symbols in common places. So even if your password looks strong, it might actually be easy to crack.

### What Makes a Strong Password

The solution? Stop thinking like a human. The best way to create a strong password is to let a computer do it for you. Use a password generator to make a random mix of letters, numbers, and symbols — something that doesn’t follow any pattern. Then use a password manager to remember it for you, so you don’t have to. If you still want to make your own passwords, try creating a silly and unexpected phrase using unrelated words, like “banana-laptop-starfish.” Mix in some capital letters and symbols in weird spots, and avoid anything connected to your personal life — no names, birthdays, or favorite sports teams.

### Use a Different Password for Every Account

Even with strong passwords, it's smart to use a different one for each account. That way, if one gets hacked, your other accounts stay safe. If you're a developer or manage a system, you should use tools that check if passwords have already been exposed in past data breaches, and help guide users away from weak or reused passwords.

### The Bottom Line: Be Unpredictable

In the end, <span style="background-color: yellow;">password safety isn’t just about following rules — it’s about being unpredictable.</span> Computers are powerful, but they rely on human patterns to guess passwords. So the less human your password looks, the safer you’ll be.
